---

## 🎵 **New Audio Behavior**

### **Vote and Results Pages:**
- **✅ ALWAYS** play lavender soundtrack at 8% volume
- **✅ SIMPLIFIED** cross-page audio management
- **✅ CONSISTENT** audio experience regardless of source

### **Main Application:**
- **✅ UNCHANGED** - Dual audio system (lavender + political) remains intact
- **✅ Widget 1-5** - Lavender soundtrack (50% on Widget 1, 8% on Widgets 2-5)
- **✅ Widget 6+** - Political party music (8% volume)

---

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Simplified Audio State Management:**
```javascript
// Simplified - only lavender soundtrack
const audioState = {
    currentTrack: 'lavender',  // Always lavender on vote/results pages
    lavenderIsPlaying: !backgroundMusic.paused,
    lavenderCurrentTime: backgroundMusic.currentTime,
    politicalIsPlaying: false,  // Always false
    politicalCurrentTime: 0     // Always 0
};
```

### **Simplified Cross-Page Restoration:**
```javascript
// Much simpler logic - always use lavender
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    const backgroundMusic = document.getElementById('bgMusic');
    
    // Always use lavender soundtrack on voting pages at 8% volume
    const audioState = localStorage.getItem('nostalgiaAudioState');
    if (audioState) {
        const state = JSON.parse(audioState);
        if (state.lavenderIsPlaying && state.lavenderCurrentTime !== undefined) {
            backgroundMusic.volume = 0.08;
            backgroundMusic.currentTime = state.lavenderCurrentTime;
            backgroundMusic.play();
        }
    } else {
        // Default to lavender soundtrack at 8% volume
        backgroundMusic.volume = 0.08;
        backgroundMusic.play();
    }
});
```

## 🎯 **User Experience Impact**

### **Before Simplification:**
- ❓ **Confusing** - Political music could continue on voting pages
- 🔀 **Complex** - Dual audio system on pages that don't need it
- 🎵 **Inconsistent** - Different audio depending on source widget

### **After Simplification:**
- ✅ **Consistent** - Always peaceful lavender soundtrack on voting pages
- ✅ **Simple** - Single audio track, easier to maintain
- ✅ **Intuitive** - Voting experience separated from political theme music
- ✅ **Clean** - Reduced complexity without losing functionality

## 📊 **Simplified Audio Flow**

### **Scenario 1: From Peaceful Widgets (1-5)**
```
Widget 1-5 (Lavender) → Vote/Results (Lavender) → Seamless continuation
```

### **Scenario 2: From Political Widgets (6+)**
```
Widget 6+ (Political) → Vote/Results (Lavender) → Clean transition to peaceful voting
```

### **Scenario 3: Return to Main App**
```
Vote/Results (Lavender) → Main App → Restores appropriate track based on current widget
```

---

## 🧪 **Testing**

### **Test File Created:**
- **`test_simplified_voting_audio.html`** - Comprehensive testing for simplified system

### **Expected Behavior:**
1. **All voting pages** → Play lavender soundtrack at 8%
2. **All results pages** → Play lavender soundtrack at 8%  
3. **Audio continuity** → Maintains playback position within voting flow
4. **Return to main app** → Properly restores dual audio system state
