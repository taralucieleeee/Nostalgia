# Reset Functionality Summary

## Overview
The 'R' key now works as a reset button across all widgets, taking users back to Widget 1 (the start screen).

## Implementation Details

### Main Navigation (main.js)
- **'R' key handler**: Resets to Widget 1 with visual feedback
- **Works for**: All widgets that don't override keyboard handling

### Widget-Specific Behavior

#### Widget 1 (FirstWidget)
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js
- **Notes**: No custom keyboard handling, main.js handles all navigation

#### Widget 2 (SecondWidget) 
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js
- **Notes**: No custom keyboard handling, main.js handles all navigation

#### Widget 3 (VideoWidget - archbridge video)
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js
- **Notes**: Modified to allow 'R' key to pass through during video playback
- **Special behavior**: Blocks all other keys during video playback except 'R'

#### Widget 4 (VideoWidget2 - bertelmannstiftung video)
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js  
- **Notes**: Only handles 'A', 'D', and Space keys; 'R' passes through to main.js

#### Widget 5 (VideoWidget3 - three-video sequence)
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js
- **Notes**: Only handles 'A', 'D', and Space keys; 'R' passes through to main.js

#### Widget 6 (VideoWidget4 - politics_1 video)
- **Reset**: ✅ Handled by main.js
- **Notes**: Modified to allow 'R' key to pass through both during and after video playback
- **Special behavior**: Blocks all other keys during video playback except 'R'

## User Experience
- **Consistent**: Press 'R' from any widget to return to start screen
- **Visual feedback**: Uses the same transition system as other navigation
- **Reliable**: Works even during video playback on all video widgets
- **Immediate**: No delays or additional confirmations required

## Technical Implementation
1. **main.js** handles the core reset logic for all widgets
2. **Video widgets** that have custom keyboard handlers allow 'R' to pass through
3. **Visual feedback** is applied through the standard navigation system
4. **Widget cleanup** is handled automatically during navigation
